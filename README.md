# Advent of code for 2024
> Solved in the absence of PSTs Advent Calendar

Each task is solved in Haskell managed by GHCup, dependencies are listed in .cabal.
New dependencies are added by running 

```shell
cabal install --lib <dependency>
```

Logic for solving a task is in x.hs meanwhile the input data is stored within x.txt. Answers will be printed to console when running the solution.
